# tetris-web-app
Tetris web application coded in HTML CSS and JavaScript
This is an exercise to upgrade my skills with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I also wanted to work on a bigger project.
My initial design is based on using a table as the playing area and using the background style of the cells to highlight the different shapes.
I am currently working on the functions that provide the transformations each shape can go through when the respective key is pressed:
  - Clockwise rotation
  - Counter clockwise rotation
  - Orizontal movement (left and right)
  - Vertical movement (down)
  
  
 
Once all these are implemented I will work on gravity and collision detection. Lastly I will implement the desappearance of completed rows and a point system.
I am eager to see how the project evolves and if the final product will be consistent with my initial design, I would also love to receive input and help with it!
Anyone at a junior level is welcome to join.
Thank you for reading!
